            <p style="padding:1px 230px 1px 230px ">This guy has got to be the biggest influence in my life if we are being honest i genuinely don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for him.</p>
            <p style="padding:1px 230px 1px 230px ">His music has done a lot for me ,I know i sound very <big style="color:gold ">Gen Z</big> right now but this is the one exception music is just something else</p>
            <p style="padding:1px 230px 1px 230px ">My love for electronic music started even before I got to know of Martin's music to be honest it started off back in the day with Tim Bergling popularly known as <b style="color:darkgrey "><i>Avicii</i></b>. To this day i still remember how
                it felt listening to "Wake me up " for the first time on KTN one evening when i was from school. Honestly i can't remember the exact year this happened but all i know is that that evening changed the course of my entire life</p>

            <p style="padding:1px 230px 1px 230px ">Well enough about me raging about my discovery of music and back to the main subject how Martin Garrix as an individual and how his music has influenced my life</p>
            <p>For the most part I've always wanted the conventional 9-5 job but with the current state of things in the country its more of a 5-9 cause you'll most definately wake at 5 to get to work on time and get home at 9 cause Kenya has gog some of
                the most beautiful traffic in the world. But right after watching the first episode of the Martin Garrix show well lemme just say i wanted to be a dj. Whenever I tell anyone that what i wanna do with my life is to be a Dj they just think
                its a waste </p>
